      What Is A Croissant Made Of?
      A croissant is typically made of yeast-risen dough. The dough is first layered with butter and then rolled. It is folded many times in a process called lamination. Then the dough is cut into triangles, rolled to form a crescent shape and baked. The lamination process gives croissants its flaky texture and fluffy shape.
